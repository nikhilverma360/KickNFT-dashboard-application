    text: "Maybe you have ridden a lot of E-bikes before, but trust me, Afreda S6 is so extraordinary that will bring you unprecedented riding experience beyond your imaginationÔºÅ  Inspired by world's 1st reverse 3-wheel motorcycle-- PIAGGIO MP3, Afreda S6 is one of the most convenient and safest folding 3-wheel E-bike. It's powerful, portable, conspicuous, and stable to ride. Notably, it can be folded up and unfolded in 1 step for just 1 second! It has 2 riding modes which is perfect for any riders (Even kids and elderly can ride it safely) in any given situation (commute, family outings, and off-road).",

In free riding mode, the Articulated Quadrilateral Suspension Structure can move freely both horizontally and vertically.  The Afreda S6 fully shows its superior shock absorption and flexibility, especially on the off-road.",
    text3:
        "For beginners, the elderly, and kids, we recommend the Self-Balancing mode which the Suspension Structure is locked. In this mode, the AQSS cannot move horizontally and vertically, maintaining a stable position of the rectangular state so that Afreda's  2 front wheels are on stable balanced. It can turn and run like riding a normal tricycle. It is the safest way of riding and will not fall even it is stopped(without kickstand),  but in this mode Afreda will lose some damping effect and must drive at a low speed.",
